# Language Detection

We have built a model that can predict language using text. This is the solution to many applications of artificial intelligence and computational linguists. This type of prediction is widely used in machine translation and robots on electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. It also helps track and analyze information in multiple languages.


## Dataset Description

We are using the Language Detection dataset, which contains text details for 17 different languages.

## Conclusion

The bag-of-words model becomes a way to represent data. Text extraction and vectorization are important steps for good prediction in NLP. In such text classification problems, Naive Bayes is always a better model and thus we get better results.
